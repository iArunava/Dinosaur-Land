# Dinosaur-Land 🦕 🦕 🦕

In this repository, I have coded a character level RNN Recurrent Neural Network *from scratch* to learn the Dinosaur Names
and predict new Dinosaur Names!! <br/>
The RNN coded can be used to save the trained weights as well as load the weights from previous training!!
 🦕 🦕 Exciting!! 🦕 🦕

## How to use 🦕

1. Clone the repository and cd into it 🦕
```
git clone https://github.com/iArunava/Dinosaur-Land.git
cd Dinosaur-Land/
```

2. Get the dataset 🦕
```
python3 ./dataset/get_dinosaur_names.py
```

3. Train the model (and save [by default] `-s 0` to not save model) 🦕
```
python3 init.py -lr 0.03 -e 50000
```

4. Sample from the saved model 🦕
```
python3 init.py -t 0
```

5. To set more options use 🦕
```
python3 init.py --help
```
